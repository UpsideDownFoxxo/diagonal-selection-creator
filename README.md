# diagonal-selection-creator
Tool to quickly generate diagonal selections to be used in litematica

## How to Use:
### Tool:
- `step size`: the size of each sub-region. Lower numbers result in less air, but also increase sub-region count
- `thickness`: the size of the build along one axis
- `height`: height of the sub-regions
- `length`: the "length" of the diagonal. Use the difference of the X or Z coordinates of the start-/endpoint
- `name`: the name of the resulting .litematica file

### Minecraft:
Drop into litematics folder, then `Area Selection Browser > From Placement`
